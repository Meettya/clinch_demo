###
This is simple test case for Jade-powered template engine
must work in node AND in browser
may be used as example
###

###
this two must be reqiured for node
if you prefer have all require() in file head (an I think it good habit)
- you need to REPLACE it in clinch settings, not exclude!!!
###
fs = require 'fs'
jade = require 'jade'

###
This function render results with jade template and given data
Its dual-headed version, works in node and in browser
###
greater = (data) ->

  # clinch will emulate module, but NOT emulate module.id
  template_fn = if module.id

    # if we are here - its node env and we are should build template
    template_name = "#{__dirname}/tmpl/template.jade"
    template = fs.readFileSync template_name, 'utf8'

    # its very close to clinch default settings for jade
    options = 
      pretty : on
      self : on
      filename : template_name

    jade.compile template, options

  # unless module.id  - its clinched (browser version) code
  else
    # just require it and it will be done
    require './tmpl/template'


  res = template_fn data

module.exports = {
  greater
